# detecting-sexism

In the context of the final project for Le Wagon Data Science & AI course, we will strive to build an NLP model able to detect sexism in text. 

As opposed to previous research and models, we will use a dataset composed of many sources, not limited to social media. 

The initial classification will be a binary 'sexist' or 'not sexist'. As the datasets use different annotation rules, we hope to provide a richness and nuance to the model, at the risk of being 'overly accusatory'. 

The options for further exploration include, but are not limited to:
* Developing a french model
* Developing a multi-lingual model
* Augmenting our dataset(s)
  * Translation
  * Scraping reddit/instagram/youtube/twitch
  * Generative AI
  * Text templates (eg, "I hate women, they're all (bitch/slut/whore)s")
* Annotating our own data set based on gender theory and language theory
* Multi-class classification
